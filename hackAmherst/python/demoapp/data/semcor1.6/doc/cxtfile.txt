NAME

Format of semantic concordance file

DESCRIPTION

A semantic concordance consists of texts that have been syntactically and
semantically tagged. The semantic tagging was done by hand, using various
tools to annotate the English text with WordNet senses. The "raw" data were
reformatted and syntactically tagged before semantic tags were assigned. See
semcor(7WN) for more information about semantic concordances.

For historical reasons, semantic concordance files are referred to as
context files . Some of the field element within context files reflect that
history, as well.

File Format

Regardless of which files comprise a semantic concordance, and which words
are tagged, the format of each concordance file is the same. The context
file format follows SGML guidelines, using elements and attribute/value
pairs to record information about the file, paragraph and sentence
boundaries, and syntactic and semantic information. SGML elements give a
file its structure; attribute/value pairs provide additional information.
All SGML elements require both start and end tags.

SGML attribute/value pairs are of the form:

       attribute = value

Our SGML format deviates from the standard in that value s are only enclosed
in quotation marks when there may be embedded spaces. Due to the large
number of attribute/value pairs, the presence of quotation marks around each
value would have substantially increased the size of the concordances.

Nomenclature

The structure of a context file is specified below in pseudo-BNF notation.
Each SGML element is on a separate line. Terminals are printed in boldface
and are represented in the file as written. Items in italics are variables.
Upper-case strings are non-terminals.

Interpretation of SGML Elements

<contextfile concordance= conc >
     This element indicates the beginning of a context file. conc specifies
     the name of the semantic concordance that the file is in. A semantic
     concordance file contains one or more context elements from the same
     semantic concordance. See semcor(7WN) for a list of semantic
     concordance names.
<context filename=filename paras=yes>
     This element indicates the beginning of a context. filename is the name
     of the original corpora file from which this context was extracted.
     paras indicates that this document contains paragraph delimiters.
<p pnum=paragraph_number >
     Start of a new paragraph. paragraph_number is an integer. The first
     paragraph in a context is numbered 1 , and paragraph numbers are
     incremented sequentially.
<s snum=sentence_number >
     Start of a new sentence. sentence_number is an integer. The first
     sentence in each context is numbered 1 , and sentence numbers are
     incremented sequentially throughout the context . Sentence numbers do
     not restart at 1 in each paragraph.
<wf attribute/value_pairs > word </wf>
     This element represents a word form. word is the orthographic form as
     it appears in the original document. All of the syntactic and semantic
     information is stored as attribute/value pairs described below.

     cmd= cmd
          Indicates the status of the wf element.

             cmd                         Meaning

           tag      word is to be tagged

           done     word is semantically tagged

           ignore   word should not be tagged

           update   used during semantic concordance development only

           retag    used during semantic concordance development only
     pos= pos
          pos is the syntactic tag assigned by Eric Brill's stochastic
          part-of-speech tagger. See Syntactic Tags below for a list of
          possible values.
     lemma= lemma
          The base form of the word or collocation that the other
          attribute/value pairs in this wf pertain to. This is the form of
          the string used to search the WordNet database. If rdf is present,
          lemma is the base form of the redefinition. When pn is present,
          redefinition , lemma and category all have the same value.
     wnsn= sense_number
          sense_number is the integer sense number corresponding to the
          WordNet output display.
     lexsn= lex_sense
          lex_sense , when concatenated onto lemma using % as the
          concatenation character, creates a sense_key that indicates the
          WordNet sense to which word should be linked. This is the semantic
          tag for word . The format of a sense_key is described in
          senseidx(5WN) .
     pn= category
          Indicates that word is a proper noun categorized as one of the
          values of CATEGORY. When pn is present, redefinition , lemma and
          category all have the same value.
     rdf= redefinition
          If present, word has been "redefined" to something else. This is
          mainly used to define discontinuous collocations, correct
          typographical errors in the text, or to enter a string that should
          be used to search WordNet instead of word in order to find an
          appropriate sense for the semantic tag. When pn is present,
          redefinition , lemma and category all have the same value.
     dc= distance
          Indicates that word is part of a discontinuous collocation in
          which the words comprising the collocation are not adjacent.
          distance is an integer that specifies how many wf elements away
          the semantic tag for the collocation is. It may be either
          negative, indicating wf elements prior to this one, or positive,
          indicating wf elements following in the file.
     sep=" separator_string "
          Indicates that the space between this wf element and the next
          should be displayed as separator_string . The string may be one or
          more character. The default word separator is one space.
     tagnote= tagnote_type
          A tagnote attribute/value pair is always present if cmd is update
          or retag . This is used only during semantic concordance
          development, and indicates the type of problem encountered during
          semantic tagging. See TAGNOTE_TYPE for a list of possible values.
     note=" note"
          A note attribute/value pair is always present with tagnote . note
          may contain a string that provides additional information about
          the tagnote , or may be empty.
     ot= other_tag
          If present, a semantic tag cannot be assigned to word for one of
          the reasons listed in OTHER_TAG.
